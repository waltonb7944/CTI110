# Assuming no delays, the distance that a car travels down the interstate
# can be calculated with the formula: Distance = Speed X Time

# Assign the speed of 70 MPH 

speed = 70

# Assign the different hours the car will travel

hours6 = 6
hours10 = 10
hours15 = 15

# multiple the speed by how many hours the car traveled

distanceAfter6 = speed * hours6
distanceAfter10 = speed * hours10
distanceAfter15 = speed * hours15

# display hour far the car traveled in those hours
